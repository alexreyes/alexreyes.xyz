# My-Website
A simple website that I probably won't upload to the internet for a long time. I'm currently working on free code camp
and using this as a canvas to practice what I learn. This website was made in part by bootstrap. 

If you want to see what it looks like, download it and open the index.html file or go here: http://reyesal.github.io/My-Website.
